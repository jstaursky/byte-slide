* Instructions
The python script that runs is =tester.py=, but it must be run through the =test.sh=
shell wrapper (this sets the runtime linker path so =libsla.so= can be found). 

but first you need to:
- Run =make= in the root =/hutch= directory, this will build the necessary shared
  library =libsla.so=.
- Enter =pyx= directory found inside this directory and run =make=. This will build
  the shared library that python can use.
- Next run  
#+begin_src sh
chmod +x test.sh
#+end_src
To make the shell script executable.

After all that you should be able to run 
#+begin_src sh
./test.sh
#+end_src

and be greeted with
#+begin_src text
--- 0x00001000:PUSH EBP
--- 0x00001001:MOV EBP,ESP
--- 0x00001003:MOV EAX,0x12345678
#+end_src

* CAVEAT
