# hutch (a sleigh library derivative)
Separate the sleigh compiler from Ghidra, a rewritten Makefile.

I had trouble with the existing Makefile in the Ghidra repository and so after
some trial and error to get a successful build, I decided to rewrite it. So I
rewrote the Makefile, and built (IMO) a better folder structure for using sleigh
as a library.

The intent is not to be in 1-1 sync with the sleigh code-base found in ghidra, I
will be making my own modifications and eventually the two codebases will be
incompatible--Hence the change in name (as well as to avoid potiential trademark
issues). That said, until I start implementing my own changes, this repo will
try and stay up to date. I am still analyzing the codebase.

# BUILDING

Type `make` in `hutch` main directory.

# WINDOWS BUILDING
Assuming your running under an mingw-w64-x86_64 style environment, after
installing `bison` and `flex` (and `g++` + `binutils` + etc.), execute `make
sleigh-compile CXX='g++ -D_WINDOWS '`,

the rest of the instructions are same as above but always append the `make`
commands with `CXX='g++ -D_WINDOWS '` otherwise you will run into errors.
